This Act may be cited as the Division of Revenue\n(Amendment) Act, 2024.\n\n2. The object and purpose of this Act is to amend the\nDivision of Revenue Act, 2024, (hereinafter referred to as\nthe “principal Act’) to provide for equitable sharing of the\nshortfall in revenue raised nationally, occasioned by\ndownward revision of projected ordinary revenue, among\nthe national government and county governments.\n\n3.

County equitable 24.20%\nshare 380,000,000,000\n\n\nThe Division of Revenue (Amendment) Bill, 2024 887\n\nMEMORANDUM OF OBJECTS AND REASONS\n\nThe principal object of this Bill is to provide for equitable sharing of\nthe revised sharable revenue raised nationally by the national government\namong the national government and county governments.\n\nThe projected revenues raised nationally for the financial year\n2024/25 have dropped significantly, due to the revised revenue raising\nmeasures occasioned by rejection of the Finance Bill, 2024, by KSh.\n346.00 billion, from the initial projected revenue of KSh. 2,948.12\nbillion to revised projected revenue of KSh. 2,602.12 billion.\n\nIn this regard, the National Government share of revenue raised\nnationally has been adjusted downward by KSh. 325.88 billion. This\nshortfall in share of national government revenue has been partly covered\nby adjustment of budgetary allocations to the Executive, the Legislature,\nthe Judiciary and constitutional commissions in the financial year\n2024/25.\n\nIn this regard, and in order to facilitate bridging the above financing\ngap as well as facilitate the National Government to provide resources\ntowards critical areas, the Bill proposes that the county governments\nequitable share for FY 2024/25 be reduced by KSh. 20.12 billion. This\ntranslates to 5.81 percent of the projected shortfall in total sharable\nrevenue.\n\nClauses 1 and 2 of the Bill provide for the short title of the Bill; and\nthe object and purpose of the Bill.\n\nClause 3 of the Bill amends section 5(1) of the Division of Revenue\nAct, 2024 to provide for sharing of the shortfall in revenue raised\nnationally between the national and county governments equitably. The\nclause also provides for capping of the proportion of revenue shortfall to\nbe borne by county governments which shall not be more than 15 % of\nthe shortfall to ensure stable and predictable allocation of revenue in line\nwith Article 203 of the Constitution.\n\nClause 4 of the Bill deletes the Schedule to the Division of the\nRevenue Act on allocations of revenues raised nationally between\nnational government and county government and replaces it with a new\nSchedule which reduces the equitable share county governments from\nKSh. 400.12 billion to KSh. 380.00 billion; and reduces the equitable\nshare to the National Government from KSh. 2,540.15 billion to KSh.\n2,214.27 billion.\n\nThe revised allocation of KSh. 380.00 billion to county\ngovernments translates to 24.20 percent of the last audited and approved\n\n888 The Division of Revenue (Amendment) Bill, 2024\n\nrevenues of government for financial year 2020/21, which is above the\nConstitutional threshold of 15 percent.\n\nThe Schedule captures the approved vertical allocations of revenues\nraised nationally for FY 2024/25 and the proposed revisions to these\nallocations in FY 2024/25 and the resulting variances.\n\nThe readjusted sharable revenue amounting to KSh. 2,602.12\nbillion implies a deviation of KSh. 346.00 billion which translates to\n11.74 percent reduction in the original projected sharable revenue of\nKSh. 2,948.12 billion.\n\nIn order to ensure that the national government and county\ngovernments are able to perform assigned functions, as well as ensure the\nNational Government is able to provide requisite resources to address the\ncritical expenditures, the National Treasury proposes that both levels of\ngovernment bear this shortfall equitably by reducing the equitable share\nto county governments by KSh. 20.12 billion which translates to 5.81\npercent of the projected KSh. 346.00 deviation in projected sharable\nrevenue.\n\nThe National Government on its part will bear a significantly higher\nshare of the shortfall amounting to KSh. 325.88 billion, or 94.19 percent\nof the projected shortfall of KSh. 346.00. The shortfall will be offset by\nexpenditure reduction by putting in place austerity measures.\nConsequently, it’s expected that county governments should also revise\ntheir budgets downwards to reflect the shortfalls and comply with the\nrevised schedule.\n\nDated the 17th July, 2024.\n\nNDINDI NYORO,\nChairperson, Budget and Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe Division of Revenue (Amendment) Bill, 2024 889\n\nSection 4 of No. 5 of 2024 which it is proposed to amend—\n\n4. Revenue raised by the national government in respect of the\nfinancial year 2024/25 shall be divided among the national and county\ngovernments as set out in the Schedule to this Act.\n\nSection 5 of No. 5 of 2024 which it is proposed to amend—\n\n5. (1) If the actual revenue raised nationally in the financial year falls\nshort of the expected revenue set out in the Schedule, the shortfall shall be\nborne by the national government.\n\n(2) If the actual revenue raised nationally in the financial year\nexceeds the projected revenues set out in the Schedule, the excess revenue\nshall accrue to the national government, and may be used to reduce\nborrowing or pay debts.\n\nThe Schedule to the Act which it is proposed to amend—\nSCHEDULE (s.4)\n\nALLOCATION OF REVENUE RAISED NATIONALLY BETWEEN\nTHE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND COUNTY GOVERNMENTS\nFOR THE 2024/25 FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nAmount in KSh.
