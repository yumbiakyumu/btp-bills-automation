It seeks to allow for the seamless movement of these officers\nbetween county public services without compromising their accrued\nbenefits, thus promoting efficiency, national integration, cohesion, and the\neffective delivery of public services across counties. The proposed\nlegislation opens the avenue for counties to send and receive experienced\nofficers based on specific needs. By allowing officers to transfer between\ncounties, the Bill ensures that expertise and competencies can be evenly\ndistributed, thus enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of public\nservice delivery across the nation.\n\nThe Bill further seeks to establish a county public service board\nconsultative forum which recognizes the critical role played by the\nindividual County Public Service Boards and seeks to offer a more robust\nand collaborative platform to facilitate their functions.\n\nStatement on the delegation of legislative powers and limitation of\nfundamental rights and freedoms\n\nThe Bill does not contain any provisions limiting any fundamental\nrights or freedoms in the Bill of Rights and it does not delegate legislative\npowers.\n\nStatement on how the Bill concerns county governments\n\nThe Bill concerns county governments as stipulated under Article\n110(1)(a) of the Constitution. The Bill addresses the inter-county\nmovement of pensionable county public officers, a matter directly linked\nto the human resource functions of county governments as highlighted in\nthe Fourth Schedule. By providing a framework for the transfer of officers\nbetween counties, the Bill has a direct bearing on the powers and\nresponsibilities of counties to manage their personnel for effective service\ndelivery. Furthermore, the safeguarding of rights and benefits for\ntransferring officers also impacts county financial obligations and\nadministrative functions. Therefore, the Bill affects the functions and\npowers of county governments as enumerated in the Fourth Schedule of\nthe Constitution.\n\nStatement that the Bill is not a money Bill within the meaning of\nArticle 114 of the Constitution\n\nThe enactment of this Bill shall not occasion additional expenditure\nof public funds.\n\nDated on the 15th May, 2024.\n\nGEORGE MBUGUA,\nSenator.\n\nThe County Governments (Amendment) Bill, 2024 781\n\nSection 2 of Cap 265 of the laws of Kenya, which it proposes to amend—\n\n2.

Paragraph 7(d) of Part 2 of the Fourth Schedule to the\nConstitution designates local tourism as a function of county governments.\n\nThe Bill therefore affects the functions and powers of county\ngovernments in terms of 110(1)(a) of the Constitution.\n\nStatement that the Bill is not a money Bill within the meaning of\nArticle 114 of the Constitution\n\nThe Bill deals with matters other than those listed in the definition of\na money bill under Article 114 (3) of the Constitution and is therefore not\na money Bill within the meaning of Article 114 of the Constitution.\n\nDated the 11th June, 2024.\n\nBETTY BATULI MONTET,\nSenator.\n\n742\n\nThe County Tourism Bill, 2024\n\nSection 7 of No. 28 of 2011 which it is proposed to amend —\n\nFunctions of the\nAuthority.\n\n12.

Further, the Public collections Act excludes from its purview,\ncharitable and religious purposes yet this forms a large component of\nharambees.\n\nThe Bill is also based on the need to reduce the culture of\ndependency that harambees have imbued in society, extending even\nessentially private affairs to the larger public. The Bill seeks to restrict its\napplication to private fundraising appeals except where such appeals fall\nwithin public appeals for public purposes. Its passage will promote the use\nof devolved structures as entities for promoting structured social\ndevelopment by ensuring that the conduct of public appeals are approved\nby assessing their links to the needs and priorities of the counties and their\ndecentralized structures.\n\nTo support voluntary contributions, it is imperative that the state\ngrants incentives to such givers. The current regulatory regimes are\nlimited in their financial incentives and essentially excludes private\nindividuals. This Bill will provide frameworks within which financial\nincentives can be issued to voluntary contributions.\n\nThe Bill-\n\n(a) confers functions on the relevant Cabinet Secretary and the\nrespective county executive committee members functions in\nrelation to the issuance of permits, regulates and monitors the\nconduct of fundraising appeals and establishes mechanisms for\nthe promotion of transparency and accountability in the conduct\n\nThe Public Fundraising Appeals Bill, 2024 727\n\nof fundraising appeals at the National and county levels of\ngovernment;\n\n(b) defines fundraising appeals, indicates who can undertake a\nfundraising appeal and lays out procedures for applying for\npermits, conditions to be fulfilled and consequences of not\nfollowing these conditions;\n\n(c) defines and excludes private fundraising appeals from its\nprovisions;\n\n(d) imposes obligations on State and public officers by limiting their\nparticipation in public fundraising appeals; and\n\n(e) stipulates records and accounts of fundraising appeals that must\nbe retained.\n\nStatement on the delegation of legislative powers and limitation of\nfundamental rights and freedoms\n\nThe Bill does delegates legislative powers only to the extent of giving\neffect to the provisions of the Bill it does not limit fundamental rights and\nfreedoms.\n\nStatement of how the Bill concerns county governments\n\nThe Bill makes provision for regulation of fundraising appeals at the\nnational and county levels of Government. The Bill therefore concerns\ncounty governments in terms of Article 110(a) of the Constitution as it\naffects the functions and powers of County Governments set out in the\nFourth Schedule.\n\nStatement that the Bill is not a money Bill within the meaning of\nArticle 114 of the Constitution.\n\nThe Bill is not a money bill within the meaning of Article 114 of the\nConstitution.\n\nDated 10th July, 2024.\n\nAARON CHERUIYOT,\nSenate Majority Leader."

The Bill also aims to ensure that the advertising of\ntobacco products is regulated and that the sale of tobacco products,\nincluding electronic nicotine delivery systems, to persons under the age of\neighteen years is prohibited. The Bill further seeks to regulate the\npromotion and advertising of tobacco products online or via any digital\nplatform including social media sites and video-sharing platforms.\n\nAdditionally, the Bill seeks to ensure that no products, particularly\nelectronic nicotine delivery systems are manufactured, distributed,\nimported or sold in Kenya without the prior authorisation of the Cabinet\nSecretary responsible for health. This is necessitated by the current\nsituation where products have been introduced into the market and\ndistributed without authorisation or understanding of the public health\nimpact of such products.\n\nStatement on the delegation of legislative powers and limitation of\nfundamental rights and freedoms\n\nClause 17 of the Bill empowers the Cabinet Secretary responsible for\nhealth to make Regulations on the control of tobacco and related products.\nThe Bill does not limit fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\nStatement on how the Bill concerns county governments\n\nThe Bill concerns county governments as it relates to the control of\ntobacco, which contains nicotine, a drug. Paragraph 13 of Part 2 of the\nFourth Schedule to the Constitution designates the control of drugs as a\nfunction of county governments.\n\nFurther, the Bill makes provision for the regulation of the trade and\nmarketing of tobacco and related products. Paragraph 7(a) and (b) of Part\n2 of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution designates trade development\nand regulation, including markets and trade licences, as a function of\ncounty governments.\n\nThe Bill therefore affects the functions and powers of county\ngovernments in terms of 110(1)(a) of the Constitution.\n\n686 The Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill, 2024\n\nStatement that the Bill is not a money Bill within the meaning of\nArticle 114 of the Constitution\n\nThe Bill deals with matters other than those listed in the definition of a\nmoney bill under Article 114 (3) ofthe Constitution and is therefore not a\nmoney Bill within the meaning of Article 114 of the Constitution.\n\nDated the 12th June, 2024.\n\nCATHERINE MUYEKA MUMMA,\nSenator.\n\nThe Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill, 2024 687\n\nSection 2 of Cap. 245A., which it is proposed to amend —\n2.

It achieves this by clearly setting out the procedure for removal\nof a county governor and a county deputy governor either by impeachment\nor for incapacity and the procedure for removal of a county speaker, a\ncounty executive committee member and county secretary through a\nresolution of the relevant county assembly.\n\nThis Bill is necessitated by the lack of a comprehensive statutory\nframework for the removal, from office, of the said four categories of\ncounty state officers.

Secondly, the\nBill seeks to define the administrative framework for the County Sports\nAssociations Fund.\n\nAdditionally, the Bill outlines a comprehensive strategy for funding\nthe County Sports Associations Fund, which includes a percentage of\ncounty revenue, financial accruals from departmental activities,\ngovernment loans, grants, and donations, as well as contributions from\nsources explicitly designated for county sports associations. The\nlegislation prescribes the specific utilization of the fund, emphasizing its\nallocation towards supporting duly registered county sports associations\non an annual fiscal basis, thereby strategically directing resources towards\ngrassroots sports development.\n\nLastly, the Bill grants regulatory oversight powers to the County\nExecutive Committee member responsible for sports, enabling them to\nformulate essential rules that cover vital aspects such as eligibility criteria,\nfund disbursement procedures, and rigorous accountability measures.

It outlines the responsibilities\nof county government officials and seeks to enhance the capacity of\ncounties to support sports development within their jurisdictions.\n\nStatement that the Bill is not a money Bill within the meaning of\nArticle 114 of the Constitution\n\nThis Bill is not a money Bill within the meaning of Article 114 of the\nConstitution. It primarily deals with the establishment of a fund,\nadministrative procedures, and regulatory frameworks. While it specifies\nfunding sources and utilization, it does not alter the national budgeting\nprocess or impose taxation measures. It ensures that existing budget\nallocations are directed toward sports associations within the county,\nwithout creating new taxation or expenditure obligations.\n\nDated the 4th December, 2023\n\nEDWIN WATENYA SIFUNA\nSenator\n\nThe Sports (Amendment) Bill, 2024 633\n\nSection 2 of Act No. 25 of 2013 which it is proposed to amend\n2.

Citizens working in the\ncreative industry contribute to the gross domestic product by creating\nemployment opportunities, paying taxes as a result of the activities they\nare involved in. The creative sector also contributes to the country’s\nparticipation in the global economy as the skills and products in this sector\ntranscend borders. The needs of persons in the creative economy have\ntraditionally taken a back seat in the priorities of the state as more\nemphasis is laid on mainstream sectors. However, in an increasingly hyper\nconnected world, the creative industry is quickly outpacing other sectors\nof the economy. This Bill recognizes this watershed moment and proposes\nto make systemic interventions to ensure adequate support to persons in\nthe creative industry including proposing the formation of a Guild to\nchampion the rights and welfare of creatives.\n\nStatement on the delegation of legislative powers and limitation of\nfundamental rights and freedoms\n\nThe Bill does not limit fundamental rights and freedoms. Clause 19\nproposes to delegate legislative powers to the Cabinet Secretary\nresponsible for Trade and Industry to make Regulations for the better\ncarrying out of the provisions of the law.\n\nStatement on how the Bill concerns county governments\n\nThe creative sector contributes to development both at the national\nand county government. Further the creative industry includes activities\nculture and public entertainment. These activities relate to county\ngovernment functions under Part 2 of the Fourth Schedule to the\nConstitution. The Bill therefore affects the powers and functions of the\ncounty government and is therefore a Bill that concerns counties in terms\nof Article 110(1)(a) of the Constitution.\n\nStatement that the Bill is not a money Bill, within the meaning of\nArticle 114 of the Constitution\n\nThis Bill is not a money Bill within the meaning of Article 114 of the\nConstitution.\n\nDated the 2nd May, 2024.\n\nEDDY GICHERU OKETCH,\nSenator."

The principal Act is amended by repealing section 133 of Cap, 412A.\n\nThe Public Finance Management (Amendment) Bill, 2024 537\n\nMEMORANDUM OF OBJECTS AND REASONS\nStatement of the Objects and Reasons for the Bill\n\nThe primary objective of this Bill is to amend the Public Finance\nManagement Act, Cap. 412A, to rectify ambiguities and inconsistencies\nwithin the existing legislation, particularly concerning the submission and\npassage timelines of a County Finance Bill. The Bill mandates that the County\nExecutive Committee Member for finance is required to submit a County\nFinance Bill to the respective County Assembly by April 30th each year,\nensuring it is passed before the end of the financial year on June 30th. This\namendment aligns with the stipulations of section 129(1)(b) of the Public\nFinance Management Act, which outlines the responsibilities of the County\nExecutive Committee member regarding the submission of budget estimates\nand legislative requirements for the implementation of the county government\nbudget.\n\nThis legislation addresses the current legislative ambiguity where, on one\nhand, the County Executive Committee member for finance is expected to\nsubmit budget estimates along with necessary draft bills to the County\nExecutive Committee, including the Finance Bill, while on the other, they are\ninstructed to submit all required bills to implement the budget—excluding the\nFinance Bill—to the County Assembly by April 30th. This discrepancy has\nled to delays and inefficiencies in county financial management, with some\ncounties failing to meet the critical timeline for passing the County Finance\nBill as outlined in section 133 of the Public Finance Management Act.\n\nThe necessity for this amendment is further underscored by the\nprecedence set by the National Assembly following the case of Petition No.\n253 of 2018 (Okiya Omtatah Okoiti V Cabinet Secretary, National Treasury\n& 3 Others). The judicial decision highlighted the violation of the statutory\ntimelines by the Cabinet Secretary and resulted in the amendment of the\nPublic Finance Management Act through the Statute Law (Miscellaneous\nAmendments) Act, 2019, introducing section 39A to rectify similar issues at\nthe national level.\n\nStatement on the delegation of legislative powers and limitation of\nfundamental rights and freedoms\n\nThe Bill does not contain any provisions limiting any fundamental rights\nor freedoms in the Bill of Rights and it does not delegate legislative powers.\n\nStatement on whether the Bill concerns County Governments\n\nThis Bill concerns county governments in terms of Article 110(1)(a) of\nthe Constitution as it directly impacts the functions and powers of county\ngovernments as set out in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution.\n\n538 The Public Finance Management (Amendment) Bill, 2024\n\nSpecifically, the Bill addresses the legislative and financial management\nresponsibilities of county governments, ensuring a streamlined process for the\npreparation, submission, and approval of the County Finance Bill.\n\nStatement that the Bill is not a money Bill within the meaning of Article\n114 of the Constitution\n\nThe Bill is not a money Bill within the meaning of Article 114 of the\nConstitution.\n\nDated the 30th April, 2024.\n\nAARON CHERUIYOT,\nSenate Majority Leader.\n\nThe Public Finance Management (Amendment) Bill, 2024 539\n\nSection 129(2)(a) of Cap. 412A which it is proposed to amend—\n\n129. County Executive Committee member to submit budget\nestimates and other documents to County Executive Committee for\napproval\n\n(1) A County Executive Committee member for finance shall submit\nto the County Executive Committee for its approval—\n\n(a) the budget estimates and other documents supporting the budget\nof the county government, excluding the county assembly; and\n\n(b) the draft Bills at county level required to implement the county\ngovernment budget, in sufficient time to meet the deadlines\nprescribed by this section.\n\n(2) Following approval by the County Executive Committee, the\nCounty Executive Committee member for finance shall—\n\n(a) submit to the county assembly the budget estimates, supporting\ndocuments, and any other Bills required to implement the budget,\nexcept the Finance Bill, by the 30th April in that year; and\n\n(b) ensure that the estimates submitted in subsection (a) are in\naccordance with the resolutions adopted by county assembly on\nthe County Fiscal Strategy Paper.\n\nSection 132 of Cap. 412A which it is proposed to delete—\n\n132. Submission and consideration of the revenue raising\nmeasures in the county assembly\n\n(1) Each financial year, the County Executive member for finance\nshall, with the approval of the County Executive Committee, make a\npronouncement of the revenue raising measures for the county\ngovernment.\n\n(2) The County Executive Committee member for finance shall, on\nthe same date that the revenue raising measures are pronounced, submit to\nthe county assembly the County Finance Bill, setting out the revenue\nraising measures for the county government, together with a policy\nstatement expounding on those measures.\n\n(3) Any recommendations made by the relevant committee or\nadopted by the county assembly on revenue matters shall—\n\n(a) ensure that the total amount of revenue raised is consistent with\nthe approved fiscal framework and the County Allocation of\nRevenue Act;\n\n540 The Public Finance Management (Amendment) Bill, 2024\n\n(b) take into account the principles of equity, certainty and ease of\ncollection;\n\n(c) consider the impact of the proposed changes on the composition\nof tax revenue with reference to direct and indirect taxes;\n\n(d) consider domestic, regional and international tax trends;\n\n(e) consider the impact on development, investment, employment\nand economic growth; and\n\n(f) take into account the taxation and other tariff agreements and\nobligations that Kenya has ratified, including taxation and tariff\nagreements under the East African Community Treaty.\n\nSection 133 of Cap. 412A which it is proposed to delete—\n133. Approval of the Finance Bill\n\nNot later than ninety days after passing the Appropriation Bill, the\ncounty assembly shall consider and approve the Finance Bill with or\nwithout amendments."
